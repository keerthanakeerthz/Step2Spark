<h3>OUR APPROACH</h3>
<p>There are many group of people  who provide food and place to stay for the mentally and physically disabled children but the  education is questionable.We believe that personal care alone for them is not enough, they should also be treated as normal children who can access digital learning.So we decided to provide such platform for physically and mentally disabled children which can be accessed under guidance by their guardians/parents/teachers.</p>
<h3>WHAT WE DO</h3>
<p>Step2Spark provides learning for those children through online.It contains activities like yoga, excercise,games, learning , motivational vedios, daily life activities . It improves their mind. We engage them providing a certificate which makes them happy and proud. </p>
